# sense_emu is the sensehat emulator package that comes with the raspberry pi for prototyping and
# and development without the actual sensehat hardware. However we do have a sense hat on the way, and once
# received, we will continue the next steps, which include, sensing orientation in the users pocket,
# and converting acceleromneter data into steps. The reason we can not do this yet, is becasue the sensehat emulator 
# has limited functionality compared to the physical sensehat
