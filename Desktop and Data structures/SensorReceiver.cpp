 * Description : THIS CLASS WILL IMPLEMENT MULTILE/PARALLEL PROCESSING
 *               1. First process will run c++ server code, until the user tells the fitbird to stop recording data
 *               2. Second process will initialize python interpreter and run python client code, which accesses accelerometer data and sends it to this class
 *
 *              We have already configured the python code to access accelerometer data, send it to SensorReceiver, and have SensorReceiver print it out on the screen.
 *              This can be seen in the roughCopy directory. So we are now just converting it to a class that our facade can create and access an object for
 *              Once this class is done, the facade/main program will be able to create a sensor receiver object, which will automatically record data, and convert it
 *              into an Activity object when done.
